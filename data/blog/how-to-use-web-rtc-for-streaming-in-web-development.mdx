> ## Introduction

WebRTC is a technology that enables web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. WebRTC has several JavaScript APIs that you can use to implement real-time communication features in your web app, such as:

- getUserMedia(): capture audio and video from the user’s device.
- MediaRecorder: record audio and video streams.
- RTCPeerConnection: stream audio and video between users.
- RTCDataChannel: stream data between users.

To use WebRTC, you need to set up a signaling mechanism to coordinate communication and send control messages between peers. Signaling methods and protocols are not specified by WebRTC, so you can use any technology that suits your needs, such as WebSocket, Socket.IO, or Firebase. You also need to use STUN and TURN servers to help peers find each other and establish a direct connection, or relay the traffic if a direct connection is not possible.

> ## Basic steps to create a WebRTC connection
The basic steps to create a WebRTC connection between two peers are:

- Use getUserMedia() to get the local video stream and display it on the web page.
- Create a RTCPeerConnection object that represents the connection between peers, and add the local stream to it.
- When the RTCPeerConnection object finds a new _ICE candidate_ (a potential way to connect to the other peer), send it to the other peer using the signaling mechanism.
- When the RTCPeerConnection object receives a new media stream from the other peer, display it on the web page.
- When the RTCPeerConnection object needs to negotiate a new session description with the other peer, create an offer or an answer and send it to the other peer using the signaling mechanism.

> ## Code snippets and explanations
Here are some code snippets that illustrate each step of creating a WebRTC connection, along with some explanations of what they do.

### Step 1 - get MediaStream
Use `getUserMedia()` to get the local video stream and display it on the web page.
```js
const localVideo = document.getElementById("localVideo");
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: true,
  audio: true,
});
localVideo.srcObject = stream;
```

This code snippet uses the getUserMedia() API to request access to the user’s camera and microphone, and returns a promise that resolves with a MediaStream object. The MediaStream object contains one or more MediaStreamTrack objects that represent the audio and video tracks. The srcObject property of the video element is set to the MediaStream object, so that the local video stream is displayed on the web page.

### Step 2 - create connection between peers
Create a RTCPeerConnection object that represents the connection between peers, and add the local stream to it.
```js
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
  iceServers: [
    // Use some public STUN servers
    { urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" },
    { urls: "stun:stun4.l.google.com:19302" },
  ],
});

for (const track of stream.getTracks()) {
  peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream);
}
```
This code snippet creates a _RTCPeerConnection_ object that represents the connection between peers. The _RTCPeerConnection_ constructor takes an optional configuration object that specifies the ICE servers to use for finding candidates. ICE stands for Interactive Connectivity Establishment, and it is a protocol for finding the best possible way to connect two peers over the internet. STUN stands for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT, and it is a type of ICE server that helps peers discover their public IP addresses. TURN stands for Traversal Using Relays around NAT, and it is another type of ICE server that acts as a relay when a direct connection is not possible.

The `addTrack()` method of the _RTCPeerConnection_ object adds a _MediaStreamTrack_ object to the connection, along with its associated MediaStream object. This means that the local stream will be sent to the other peer over the connection.

### Step 3 - find ICE candidate and send it
When the RTCPeerConnection object finds a new ICE candidate (a potential way to connect to the other peer), send it to the other peer using the signaling mechanism.
```js
peerConnection.addEventListener("icecandidate", (event) => {
  if (event.candidate) {
    // Send the ICE candidate to the other peer using the signaling mechanism
    socket.emit("candidate", event.candidate);
  }
});
```
This code snippet adds an event listener for the icecandidate event, which is triggered when the RTCPeerConnection object finds a new ICE candidate. An ICE candidate is an object that contains information about a possible way to connect to the other peer, such as IP address, port number, protocol, etc. The candidate property of the event object contains the ICE candidate, or null if there are no more candidates. If there is a candidate, it needs to be sent to the other peer using the signaling mechanism, so that they can try to connect using it. In this example, I use socket.io as the signaling mechanism, which is a library that enables real-time communication using WebSocket or HTTP polling.

### Step 4 - receive new MediaStream from other peer
When the RTCPeerConnection object receives a new media stream from the other peer, display it on the web page.
```js
const remoteVideo = document.getElementById("remoteVideo");
peerConnection.addEventListener("track", (event) => {
  // Display the remote stream on the web page
  remoteVideo.srcObject = event.streams[0];
});
```
This code snippet adds an event listener for the track event, which is triggered when the RTCPeerConnection object receives a new media stream from the other peer. The track property of the event object contains the MediaStreamTrack object that represents the received track, and the streams property contains an array of MediaStream objects that contain the track. The srcObject property of the video element is set to the first MediaStream object in the array, so that the remote video stream is displayed on the web page.

### Step 5 - signaling mechanism
When the RTCPeerConnection object needs to negotiate a new session description with the other peer, create an offer or an answer and send it to the other peer using the signaling mechanism.
```js
peerConnection.addEventListener("negotiationneeded", async () => {
  try {
    // Create an offer and set the local description
    const offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();
    await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);
    // Send the offer to the other peer using the signaling mechanism
    socket.emit("offer", offer);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
});

socket.on("offer", async (offer) => {
  try {
    // Set the remote description
    await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(offer);
    // Create an answer and set the local description
    const answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer();
    await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer);
    // Send the answer to the other peer using the signaling mechanism
    socket.emit("answer", answer);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
});
```

This code snippet adds an event listener for the negotiationneeded event, which is triggered when the RTCPeerConnection object needs to negotiate a new session description with the other peer. A session description is an object that contains information about the media and data formats, codecs, encryption, etc. that are supported by each peer. There are two types of session descriptions: offer and answer. An offer is a proposal to start or update a communication session, and an answer is a response that accepts or rejects the offer.

The `createOffer()` and `createAnswer()` methods of the RTCPeerConnection object create an offer or an answer respectively, and return a promise that resolves with a RTCSessionDescription object. The setLocalDescription() and setRemoteDescription() methods of the RTCPeerConnection object set the local or remote session description respectively, and return a promise that resolves when done. The offer or answer needs to be sent to the other peer using the signaling mechanism, so that they can accept or reject it.

WebRTC is a powerful and complex technology that enables web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. WebRTC has several JavaScript APIs that you can use to implement real-time communication features in your web app, such as getUserMedia(), MediaRecorder, RTCPeerConnection, and RTCDataChannel.
