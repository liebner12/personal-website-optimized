> ## Short Explanation

I worked on an app project as part of my studies at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. This app was designed to assist users in finding trips that include points of interest and to provide seamless navigation between them. Each trip contains detailed information about the destination, descriptions, and a multi-day plan. Additionally, the app offers similar _trip recommendations_ to help users discover destinations quickly. Users have the convenience of saving and editing their trips effortlessly.

> ## Project Goals

The main goal of this project was to create a comprehensive service that enables users to create, manage, and search for trips through an intuitive interface. The key concept was to implement a regression system that provides users with _personalized trip recommendations_ for easier navigation. After authentication, users could create trips with special integration with Google Maps, allowing them to add points to their trip plan with a simple point and click. Once they filled in all the necessary information, the app generated a navigation link for the end-user.

For this project, I utilized various tools and technologies, with the core of the app being built with Next.js and Redux Toolkit as the state manager. While most of the app is client-side rendered, I took advantage of optimizations and the recommendation system offered by Vercel's edge functions. Authentication was made possible through NextAuth.js, which seamlessly integrated Firebase (v9) for Google login and served as both the database and cloud storage for images. The use of Algolia allowed easy indexing of data for efficient searching. Styling was achieved using tailwindcss, a delightful experience for UI design, and advanced animations were implemented with the help of Framer Motion.

### Recommendation system

Developing the recommendation system presented a significant challenge. I opted for the TFIDF algorithm, which calculates term frequency and inverse document frequency. The algorithm identifies words present in each trip and computes their relevance by multiplying the term frequency with the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the word. Cosine similarity was then utilized to compare all the vectors from documents. This approach, commonly used in search engines and recommendation systems, proved to be effective and straightforward to implement.

### Animations between screens

A primary focus while creating the app was providing a smooth user experience with _captivating animations and gesture support_. _Framer Motion_ played a crucial role in this aspect, enabling seamless transitions between screens with its `<AnimatePresence/>` component. For instance, images smoothly transitioned from small cards to headers of new pages. The app also supported gesture interactions, such as dragging to remove, reordering, or rolling up lists of points of interest, facilitating quick and easy user actions.

> ## Lessons Learned

This project served as a tremendous learning experience for me, enhancing various aspects of my skillset. I delved into algorithmic approaches and gained insights into designing full-stack systems, even without traditional server setups. Working with edge functions on platforms like _Vercel_ and _Firebase_ enabled me to efficiently architect the application's backend.

As with any project, I encountered opportunities for improvement. One notable aspect was the choice of Firebase as the database and cloud storage, which, while convenient, had its limitations when it came to advanced querying. A more sophisticated solution like _PostgreSQL_ with _Prisma_ could have offered a better fit for such a complex system.

Creating the UI/UX was another valuable lesson. I utilized _Figma_ to create mockups, which greatly aided decision-making during development. My first experience with _tailwindcss_ was a revelation, allowing me to write well-designed code quickly by following predefined guidelines. The use of Framer Motion for animations was a marked improvement over simple native CSS transitions, enabling advanced animations and seamless transitions even between routes. Its gesture support was invaluable for the mobile-only application.

In conclusion, I hope you enjoyed reading about this project, and I must note that the code is continually evolving with new changes from Next.js 13 and beyond. While there is room for improvement, this project remains a valuable educational experience.
