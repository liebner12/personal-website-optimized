> ## Short Explanation

This website marks the beginning of my journey into the world of React development and provided me with the opportunity to explore the art of styling using the Bootstrap framework. Designed as an imaginary tourist enterprise, the website showcases various tours to captivating destinations. Leveraging React Router, I put considerable effort into optimizing the website with lazy loading for enhanced performance.

> ## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project was two-fold: firstly, to grasp the fundamentals of React library and secondly, to hone my skills in professional website styling. The website comprises a main page and subpages, each dedicated to selected tours to different destinations. From an enterprise standpoint, the site aims to furnish visitors with contact information and succinct descriptions of each trip.

This project was brought to life using Create React App, integrated with React Router for seamless page navigation and Bootstrap for styling. It was undertaken in 2020, during a period when class-based programming was the norm in React development, so I took the opportunity to familiarize myself with this approach.

> ## Spotlight

### First React application

One of the most pivotal aspects of this project is that it marks my maiden voyage into the React ecosystem. Previously, I had developed websites using pure HTML, CSS, and JS, as HTML (being a markup language) stands distinct from programming languages. The transition to React was a significant step in my programming journey.

### Class based components

As part of my quest to comprehend React from its foundation, I designed components using the class-based approach. Although the structure of these components wasn't overly complex, they did involve basic state management, providing me valuable insights into the workings of class-based React components.

### Styling

After my initial foray into pure HTML/CSS/JS development, I sought to adopt a styling framework to enhance my skills in crafting visually appealing web pages. Thus, I embraced Bootstrap, one of the most widely used frameworks at the time. Bootstrap facilitated the creation of responsive and faster-loading websites, thanks to the convenience of its pre-defined classes.

> ## Lessons Learned

This project provided an excellent platform for learning the initiation of projects through package managers like npm. Additionally, it served as my entry point into the realm of React development, where I explored class-based components and delved into the intricacies of state management.

The heart of this project lies in mastering styling with Bootstrap. I dedicated significant effort to acquire skills in crafting visually appealing pages and implementing responsive layouts using Bootstrap's grid system. Moreover, I delved into the creation of transitions and carousels within the framework's scope.

With a few pages to navigate, I learned about React Router, setting the foundation for my understanding of page routing in React. Although the project did not entail intricate implementations, it served as an essential stepping stone in my journey through the React ecosystem.
