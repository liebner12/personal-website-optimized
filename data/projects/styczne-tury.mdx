> ## Short Explanation

This is website created as a first attempt to build React project and also oppurtonity to learn how to style it with Bootstrap framework.
It's imaginary tourist enterprise that provides tours to some places. To navigate between pages I used React Router and put a lot of effort on
optimizing website with lazy loading.

> ## Project Goals

The main idea behind this project was to learn styling proffesionally websites and learn basics about React library.
Site is composed of main page and subpages of selected tours to some places. From enterprise perspective it was supposed to
provide contact information about it and short descriptions of each trip.

This project was made using Create React App with React Router and Bootstrap. It was created in 2020 and still back then Class-based programming
was popular in React so I wanted to learn it as well.

> ## Spotlight

### First React application

Most imporant thing about this project is that it's my first steps with React ecosystem, before I've only created sites in pure CSS/JS/HTML technologies (as HTML is not programming language ðŸ˜‰)

### Class based components

As I wanted to learn React from basics, components were created with class based approach.
The structure of them wasn't that complex but it contains some basic state managment.

### Styling

After my first site in pure HTML/CSS/JS I wanted to implement framework for styling to learn how to code styles with popular tools.
So I went for Bootstrap as it was one of the most common frameworks back in those days. It allowed to write easily responsive site and faster
with classes provided by it.

> ## Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to learn how to initialize projects with packages from package manager npm
and it was also my first steps with React library. As it was my first steps I wanted to learn everything from scratch
so I used firstly class based components and I learned how to manage state in them.

The most important part of this project is styling with Bootstrap framework. I've put a lot of effort to gain
skills to write nice looking pages and write responsive layout with grid provided by it. Also additionally I've learned
how to create transitions and carousels within scope of this framework.

This site contains few pages so I had to create navigation between them and that's how I learned about React Router library.
Of course I didn't implement anything complex but as said before it was my first steps with React ecosystem.
