> ## Short Explanation

During my studies at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting app project as part of a team. Our primary goal was to create a user-friendly service that incentivizes users for participating in surveys and questionnaires for various companies. Often, these surveys can be perceived as time-consuming and unrewarding. We wanted to change that perception by designing a system that rewards users for their valuable input.

> ## Project Goals

The main idea behind this project was to implement a complete system both on the backend and frontend, working collaboratively as a team. Our journey involved cooperation and attending meetings to craft the final product. The Proof of Concept (POC) included the application and backend server, communicating through a Rest API. In the future, we planned to expand the system by adding a website for creating admin tools to manage surveys. Additionally, end-users would have access to a dashboard with the most important data, enabling them to manage their personal information.

> ## Tech Stack Used

  <Icons icons={['reactnative', 'expo', 'redux']} />
</div>

For this project, the frontend was built as a mobile app using _React Native and the Expo platform_. On the backend, we employed the _Django framework in Python_. This tech stack was a great choice because it allowed us to create a proper API to communicate with the server. As I had prior experience with React, it was easier to transition to a similar technology. React Native proved to be a great framework with good enough performance to handle our application, while Expo simplified the development process by offering prebuilt components and icons, among other conveniences.

> ## Spotlight

### First Team Project

In this project, I collaborated with a team to bring all the functionality to life. We divided the work to effectively reach our project goals and focused on our strengths. I took charge of the frontend side of the app with support from two colleagues, who, despite their background in backend development, proved to be helpful in designing the connection with the backend.

### Communicating with backend

To ensure smooth communication with the backend, we had to carefully plan and design the API endpoints. We opted for a Rest API that was easy to integrate, and we structured our communication to be based on small, single-responsible functions. As a result, we could even write unit tests to increase the application's stability.

### Authorization

Since the application was designed for logged-in users, we devoted significant effort to handling user authentication and authorization. We set up options to login with Google and Facebook and created a Redux store to manage user information, such as the number of tokens earned and some personal data, to adapt the UI accordingly. Additionally, we carefully controlled access to various pages based on user privileges.

### Forms

In this project, I created our own form component that facilitated easy form creation with full functionality and a simple API. Developing it from scratch, rather than using tools like Formik, provided an excellent opportunity to learn about advanced state management and component structuring. The custom form component allowed us to validate input fields and manage an infinite number of sub-fields with an excellent user experience, such as focusing on the next input field.

```jsx
<Form
  buttonText="Zaloguj się"
  onSubmit={handleLogin}
  action={login}
  fields={{
    email: {
      name: 'Email',
      keyboardType: 'email-address',
      validate: [validateEmail],
      blurOnSubmit: false,
      onSubmitEditing: () => secondTextField.current.focus(),
    },
    password: {
      name: 'Hasło',
      password: true,
      secured: true,
      validate: [validatePasswordLength],
      ref: secondTextField,
    },
  }}
/>
```

> ## Lessons Learned

### How to style in Native application

Despite the similarities between React and _React Native_, especially in terms of state management, I had to learn how to style and architect small components in a project like this. While there were some differences from traditional CSS styling, the experience was generally similar. I created small components that resembled ones created with styled-components library. For instance:

```jsx
const Paragraph = ({ children, center, grey }) => {
  const styles = ScaledSheet.create({
    title: {
      fontSize: fonts.xs,
      fontFamily: fonts.secondary,
      color: grey ? colors.grey : colors.secondary,
      textAlign: center ? 'center' : 'auto',
    },
  });
  return <Text style={styles.title}>{children}</Text>;
};
```

Additionally, we established a primary source of styling with constants to easily modify and adjust our layout style.

### Single responsibility components

Maintaining clean code was a crucial aspect of this project, and we followed the _SOLID principle_, creating small functions for a single responsibility. This approach made it easier to test the code with unit tests and allowed us to structure components following the atomic architecture, which helped manage each component's responsibilities effectively.

Thanks to this project, I also gained knowledge about communication between frontend and backend environments. I learned how to properly connect applications with the server via a Rest API and handle user authorization in cases like this.

Lastly, handling user authentication and logging on the frontend side using token keys and Redux for state management became part of my skillset through this project.
