> ## Short Explanation

Development and Therapy Center was made as a draft for Polish company that provides different treatments for their patients.
I developed this website using Gatsby to firstly learn how to work with this framework and because it suits ideally needs like SSG.

> ## Project Goals

This project objective is to showcase the company and the offert, treatments that they provide.
Site contains three subpages, main one was supposed to give the user general knowledge about company,
show him links to more detailed information about equipment and treatments.

This project was made using Gatsby JS and styled-components. Even though this is only a static website that is't really complex,
this setup simplifies things like:

- reusable components - CSS-in-JS styling
- routing - just create .js files in pages directory
- SEO and optimizations - SSG, Helmet component with Open Graph meta data

> ## Spotlight

### Component based approach

The main spotlight of this project is implementation of component based structure
that was supported by styled components library and ofcourse React.

### Styling

Maybe after years this project isn't the prettiest one but still it showed me how to use
CSS-in-JS approach and I implemented some transitions, custom styling.

> ## Lessons Learned

This is my first website written in Gatsby JS and styled components so project for
company static site was a great practice. It allowed me to improve my styling skills
especially learned how to approach CSS-in-JS in projects, SEO optimizations in modern manner
and how to style SVG graphics on website.

Also this project focuses on component based development and how to structure React applications.
Thanks to that I kept my code to follow KISS and DRY principles. This allowed me to implement changes
faster and consistent through all layouts, pages.

As it was my first project in this technologies I also learned best use cases for them,
right now I wouldn't choose styled-components because it turned out it puts a heavy load
for browser to load and render CSS-in-JS and made Lighthouse score worse then expected for
this project. It would be much more efficient to use utility first framework like tailwindcss.

When it comes to Gatsby I didn't really used core feature which is GraphQL and right now I find this site to be
poorly written, but still it was step necessary to improve my coding skills and latter helped me create
comercial projects like [identt website](https://www.identt.io).
