> ## Short Explanation

I recently worked on aa website project called Development and Therapy Center, which was a prototype for a Polish company providing various treatments to patients. I chose to build the site with Gatsby, both to learn this framework and because it perfectly suited the requirements for a static site generator (SSG).

> ## Project Goals

The main goal of this project was to create a user-friendly website that showcased the company's services and treatments. The site consisted of three subpages, with the main page offering general information about the company and links to more detailed pages about their equipment and treatments.

> ## Tech Stack Used

For this project, I utilized Gatsby JS and styled-components. Even though it was a static website, this tech stack made development a breeze and offered several advantages:

- Reusability and Styling: styled-components allowed me to create reusable components with CSS-in-JS styling, making it easy to maintain and customize the styles.
- Routing and SEO: Gatsby's file-based routing simplified the process of creating new pages, and its static site generation capabilities helped with SEO and optimized the website's performance.

> ## Spotlight

### Component based approach

One of the highlights of this project was adopting a component-based structure, supported by styled-components and React. This approach made the code more organized and easier to maintain.

### Styling

While the website's design may not be the most cutting-edge today, it was a great learning experience for me. Implementing CSS-in-JS with styled-components enabled me to add custom styling and smooth transitions to the site.

> ## Lessons Learned

Building this website with Gatsby JS and styled-components was an excellent learning journey for me. I improved my styling skills and gained insights into CSS-in-JS, modern SEO practices, and styling SVG graphics.

The project also emphasized the importance of a component-based development approach. By following the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, I could easily make changes across different parts of the site.

Looking back, I realize that styled-components might not have been the best choice for this project. It impacted the website's performance, and I now consider using a utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS for similar projects.

Although I didn't fully explore Gatsby's GraphQL capabilities in this project, it served as a stepping stone for me to improve my coding skills. As a result, I successfully tackled more complex projects, including the development of the [identt website](https://www.identt.io).
