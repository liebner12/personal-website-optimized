> ## Short Explanation

This app was created as a team for course during studies in Wrocław University of Science and Technology. We wanted to create service
that would allow user to gain points for filling out surveys, questionnaires for different companies. For most of us filling them are waste of time
and we get nothing from this, so we wanted to create system that would reward user.

> ## Project Goals

The main idea behind this project was to implement complete system both on backend and frontend side in a team. We had to cooporate and
attend meetings to carve final product. POC should contain application and backend server that would communicate via Rest API and later on
we would add service as a website to create admin tools to create surveys. Also end user should have access to dashboard with most important data
and manage own personal information.

> ## Tech Stack Used

<div className="not-prose">
  <Icons icons={['reactnative', 'expo', 'redux']} />
</div>

In this project frontend was created as mobile app with React Native and Expo platform and backend was created using Django framework in Python. I think these stacks was a great choice
because we could create easily proper API to communicate with server and as I had experience with React library before it was easier to jump in to similar technology. Thanks to that we could
put more effort to improving quality of project instead of learning things from scratch. React Native came out as great framework with good enough performance to handle our application
and Expo made a lot of things easier like special development mode that's easier to configure, prebuilt components, icons.

> ## Spotlight

### First Team Project

In this project, I collaborated with a team to bring all functionality, we had to split the work to bring project to the end and focus on our strenghts.
That's why I was doing our front side of app with support from 2 collegues that even though they had more backend background they came out to be helpful designing connection with backend.

### Communicating with backend

We had to think about ways that we want to communicate with backend and ask our backend team for proper endpoints. We settled on Rest API that was easy to integrate but we structured
our system that communicate to be built with small, single resposible functions. Thanks to that we even wrote few unit tests to make application more stable.

### Authorization

This applicaton was designed for logged in user, that's why we had to put a lot of effort on properly handling user _authentication_ and _authorization_.
We set up option to login with Google and Facebook and created redux store that contained user information like amount of tokens that he gained and some personal data
to properly adjust UI. Also we controlled to which pages user has access.

### Forms

In this project I created our own form component that allowed to easily with full functionality and simple API. I wanted to
create it from scratch instead of using tools like _Formik_ because it was great oppurtonity to learn advanced state management and component structuring.
This component allows to validate provided tools and could manage infinite number of sub-fields with great UX with focusing next input field.

```jsx
<Form
  buttonText="Zaloguj się"
  onSubmit={handleLogin}
  action={login}
  fields={{
    email: {
      name: 'Email',
      keyboardType: 'email-address',
      validate: [validateEmail],
      blurOnSubmit: false,
      onSubmitEditing: () => secondTextField.current.focus(),
    },
    password: {
      name: 'Hasło',
      password: true,
      secured: true,
      validate: [validatePasswordLength],
      ref: secondTextField,
    },
  }}
/>
```

> ## Lessons Learned

### How to style in Native application

Despite the fact that React Native is very simmilar to React, especially in case of state managment I had to learn how to
style and architecture small components in project like this one. There were few differences when we compare native styling to CSS
but still it was similar experience. I have created small components that resembles ones created with styled-components library e.g.

```jsx
const Paragraph = ({ children, center, grey }) => {
  const styles = ScaledSheet.create({
    title: {
      fontSize: fonts.xs,
      fontFamily: fonts.secondary,
      color: grey ? colors.grey : colors.secondary,
      textAlign: center ? 'center' : 'auto',
    },
  });
  return <Text style={styles.title}>{children}</Text>;
};
```

Also we created main source of styling with consts to easily change and modulate our layout style.

### Single responsibility components

Another important thing is that we have put a lot of effor to make this code look clean. So we followed _SOLID_ principle
and created small code from small functions, thanks to that it came out much easier to test with unit tests and also we could structure components
in _atomic architecture_ that also helps to manage responsibilities of each components.

Thanks to making this project on both frontend and backend side I also learned how communcation works in similar environments. Not only that
I also gained skills to properly connect application with server via Rest API and how to authorize users in cases like this.

I learned also how to authorize user and how to handle logging on frontend side, how to use token keys and Redux to handle state.
